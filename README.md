Hi there, I'm Dillon ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate learner currently diving deep into C# and game development! I'm working on building my skills with Unity and C#, with the goal of creating fun and engaging games. My current project is a multiplayer party brawler, and Iâ€™m excited to share my progress as I continue to grow in the field.

ðŸŽ® What I'm Learning
Game Development: Building 2D and 3D games using Unity.

C#: Mastering object-oriented programming, design patterns (like Factory and Singleton), and game logic.

UI/UX Design: Learning to design intuitive game interfaces with Unity and improve player experience.

Multiplayer Games: Implementing fun and interactive gameplay for multiplayer experiences.

ðŸ’» What I'm Working On
Currently, Iâ€™m developing PartyBrawler, a  multiplayer party brawler game, to practice my game development and programming skills. Itâ€™s been a fun journey as I learn how to bring creative ideas to life using C# and Unity.

                                      ðŸš€ Goals
Continue learning and improving my C# skills for better game logic and design patterns.

Create a fun, interactive multiplayer game that can be played with friends.

Expand my knowledge of Unity, from scripting to animations, physics, and AI.

Build a portfolio of game projects to showcase my work and eventually launch them on platforms like Steam.
